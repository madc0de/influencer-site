This time it's gonna be responsive, I promise :smile:

- Header is responsive
- Header Menu has light hover effects.
- Mobile menu is fully working with toggle button(Pure CSS)
- product cards are somewhat responsive, but needs work. In real world all images may not be the same size.
- Fully Build using Flexbox, No Grid(Grid is relatively new, I wanted old browser support)
- em, rem, vw, vh is used for writig sizes
- CSS Castom property has been used here.
- Custom Icon Font Used.
- Missed "close" Icon in Icon Font, so used svg icon :(
